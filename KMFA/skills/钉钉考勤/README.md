# KMFA DingTalk Attendance Skill Package

Canonical path:

```text
KMFA/skills/钉钉考勤/
```

This folder packages the public-safe operating instructions, automation prompts, configuration templates, validators, PostgreSQL schema, stage-2 consensus protocol, and handoff rules for KMFA 钉钉考勤 skill.

Current status is `SCHEDULED_GROUP_DELIVERY_ENABLED_AWAITING_NATURAL_EVIDENCE`. Morning and evening outputs remain temporary reminders. They send the frozen template to the existing group target only after exact real-time integrity PASS, with a work-date/run-slot duplicate guard; failure makes zero sender calls. Manual/latest-report resend remains disabled. A completed work date receives a separate final reconciliation, and new monthly notification values read canonical `final` archives only.

It intentionally excludes private runtime data, DingTalk credentials, DWS resolved identifiers, SQLite, raw OneDrive archives, and report bodies.

Start with `SKILL.md`, then read:

```text
references/runbook.md
references/configuration.md
references/operating_contract.md
references/source_of_truth_contract.md
references/stage2_shadow_payroll_acceptance.md
docs/codex_task_pack.md
docs/acceptance_criteria.md
```

The public metadata/config source is `KMFA/metadata/`; real private attendance payloads remain in ignored private runtime or OneDrive unless explicitly exported in public-safe form.

Local Codex automation state is mirrored in `automation/`. Any change to this skill package or automation prompts must be committed and pushed to GitHub `main`.
