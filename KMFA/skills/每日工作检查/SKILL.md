# KMFA Daily Routine Check Skill

## Use First

This skill is the portable, public-safe operating entry for the KMFA DingTalk daily routine check automation.

Use it only with a clone of:

```text
LinzeColin/KMOS
```

Work from:

```text
/Users/linzezhang/Documents/Codex/KMOS
```

Project root:

```text
KMFA/
```

Skill package:

```text
KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/
```

Before acting, read:

1. `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/references/runbook.md`
2. `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/references/configuration.md`
3. `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/references/rules.md`
4. `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/references/data_contract.md`
5. `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/references/database_governance.md`
6. `KMFA/metadata/daily_routine_check/README.md`
7. The exact source or test files you will touch

## Scope

Automation name:

```text
Dingtalk-routine-check
```

Chinese name:

```text
钉钉工作检查
```

Business clock:

```text
Asia/Shanghai
```

Automation schedule:

```text
one automation only: Dingtalk-routine-check / 钉钉工作检查
business 11:35 Asia/Shanghai -> trigger_window=morning_1135
business 17:05 Asia/Shanghai -> trigger_window=evening_1705
current AEST local scheduler: 13:35 and 19:05
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=13,19;BYMINUTE=5,35;BYSETPOS=2,3
```

The Codex scheduler rule is local-wall-clock only. Do not add `DTSTART`,
`TZID`, an explicit scheduler timezone, or multiple RRULE lines. Recalculate
the local wall-clock hours when the host UTC offset changes; business date
evaluation remains `Asia/Shanghai`.

Do not create one automation per rule. `due_time` may remain in YAML as a business reference, but actual evaluation is controlled by the two trigger windows.

Canonical primary input:

```text
/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/DWS_Outputs.zip
```

This complete zip is the only upstream input. The reader streams required CSV
members in place and does not copy or extract the package. A disk
`/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/DWS_Outputs/` folder
is normally absent and must never be probed, created, materialized, or used as
a fallback. Paths such as `DWS_Outputs/<群>/...` refer only to members inside
the zip. Do not automatically evict the zip after a run; OneDrive/user policy
owns its hydration lifecycle.

This skill must not create or manage the upstream DWS archive automation. The upstream archive already exists and is treated as a producer.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not create branches, PRs, issues, or worktrees unless the user explicitly changes this rule.
- Work on `main` only.
- Push directly to `origin/main` only after validation passes.
- Do not commit `.env.local`, webhook URLs, signing keys, app secrets, token values, DWS resolved IDs, SQLite, raw JSON, raw JSONL, raw JSONL.gz, raw OCR bodies, raw screenshots, DWS output archives, robot response bodies, or OneDrive private archives.
- Do not run live DingTalk/DWS send commands without explicit current-thread authorization.
- Do not change the user's existing DWS archive automation unless the owner explicitly asks.
- Do not create multiple routine-check automations for individual rules.
- Each scheduled trigger runs exactly one corresponding trigger window once; never run both windows in one task.
- Scheduled routine checks must not run `--cleanup` or `--apply`; cleanup is separate manual maintenance.
- Do not probe, create, materialize, copy, extract, or fall back to a disk `DWS_Outputs/` input folder.
- Do not automatically evict the source zip after each run.
- Do not merge `资金账户明细表` and `资金流水明细`; they are two separate required artifacts.
- Treat `资金流水明细` and `资金明细` as the same document family.
- Do not hard-code OCR/classification keywords in Python; load them from YAML configuration.

## Current Business Rules

### Cash Monitoring

- Sender: 杨婷
- Group: 付款请示群
- Cash account document: `资金账户明细表`
- Cash flow document: `资金流水明细` / `资金明细`
- Hard threshold: 500000 RMB
- Soft threshold: 1000000 RMB
- P0 red: total available cash below hard threshold
- P1 yellow: total available cash below soft threshold but not below hard threshold
- P2 green: normal; log only, do not disturb
- Missing/late/low-confidence/OCR conflict: notify 张霖泽

## Data and Storage

Private input:

```text
/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/DWS_Outputs.zip
```

Private OneDrive routine-check archive:

```text
/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/KMFA/daily_routine_check/
```

Private local runtime:

```text
/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/KMFA/daily_routine_check/private_runtime/
```

Active SQLite ledger, notification target config, append-only JSONL logs, OCR cache references, and cleanup reports stay in OneDrive private runtime/output paths, not inside the Git package.

Every run log must include `run_at_beijing`, `check_date`, `trigger_window`, `rules_evaluated`, and `rules_skipped`. Missing or stale upstream DWS output must be recorded as `SOURCE_MISSING` or `SOURCE_STALE` and surfaced to 张霖泽 through the notification policy.

## Portable Package

- Public configuration: `KMFA/metadata/daily_routine_check/`
- Templates: `KMFA/skills/每日工作检查/templates/`
