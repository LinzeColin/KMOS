# DWS Outputs Backup

This directory is the GitHub main-line metadata backup target for the upstream
DingTalk DWS archive package used by KMFA workflows. The raw DWS output zip
stays in OneDrive and is not committed to GitHub.

Automation contract:

- Source package priority:
  1. `/Users/linzezhang/onedrive/DWS_Outputs.zip`
  2. `/Users/linzezhang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/DWS_Outputs.zip`
- Backup target:
  - `latest/manifest.json`
  - `runs/<run_id>.json`
- Raw package boundary:
  - Do not commit `DWS_Outputs.zip` or expanded raw DWS output files.
  - Manifests may record package path, byte size, SHA-256, file count, and
    DWS run summary only.
- The DWS archive automation may update this directory only after archive and
  structure validation complete without a blocking failure. Notion sync is
  best-effort: a recorded `pending` state does not block the manifest backup.
- Publishing is performed by
  `KMFA/tools/automation/backup_dws_output_manifest.py` with an explicit
  `/Users/linzezhang/Documents/Codex/KMOS` repository root, because the upstream DWS
  project directory is intentionally not a Git checkout.
- Updates must commit and push directly to `main`.
- No branch, pull request, issue, or extra worktree is allowed.
- Manifests must not include tokens, cookies, full open conversation IDs,
  Keychain data, browser cookies, raw message bodies, report bodies, or private
  authentication material.
